                <p>

                    The Daughters of Mary Mother of Mercy (DMMM) Nursery and Primary School Oyigbo, Rivers State is a mission school owned by Daughters of Mary Mother of Mercy congregation of the Holy Roman Catholic Church. The school started with Nursery School in the year 1988 by Rev. Sis.Hilda Uzokwe as the head teacher. Later in 1992, to satisfy the parents’ urge for a primary school where the good foundation laid for their children in the Nursery should be continued and out of the desire to bring up children with the fear of God and quality education,the primary school was incorporated into the system. Rev. Sis. V.C Agunwa was the first head teacher of the primary section having 42 pupils.
